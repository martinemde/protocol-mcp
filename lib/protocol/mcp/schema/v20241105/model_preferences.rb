  # The server's preferences for model selection, requested of the client during sampling.
  # 
  # Because LLMs can vary along multiple dimensions, choosing the "best" model is
  # rarely straightforward.  Different models excel in different areasâ€”some are
  # faster but less capable, others are more capable but more expensive, and so
  # on. This interface allows servers to express their priorities across multiple
  # dimensions to help clients make an appropriate selection for their use case.
  # 
  # These preferences are always advisory. The client MAY ignore them. It is also
  # up to the client to decide how to interpret these preferences and how to
  # balance them against other considerations.
